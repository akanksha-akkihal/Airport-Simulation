# Airport-Simulation
Airport Simulation using Linked lists.
The program runs through multiple units of time with 
random number of planes asking to land and take-off.

The maximum number of planes that can be present in the 
airport at unit time is 6. If more planes arrive they are 
refused.

Runway-1 is for landing , Runway-2 is for take-off
Runway-3 is for excess landing or excess takeoff when
landing queue is empty.
